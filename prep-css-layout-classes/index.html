        <h3>Raiders of the Lost ArK</h3>
        <p>This film is a 1981 American action-adventure film directed by Steven
          Spielberg and written by Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George
          Lucas and Philip Kaufman.  It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman,
          Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies, and Denholm Elliott.  Ford portrays Indiana Jones,
          a globe-trotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces in 1936 to recover
          the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make and army invicible.  Teaming
          up with his tough former lover Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to
          stop rival archaeologist Dr. Ren√© Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis
          to the Ark and its power.

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>This film is a 1984 American action-adventure film directed by Steven
          Spielberg. It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise,

          Ford who reprises his role as the title character. Kate Capshaw, Amrish
          Puri, Roshan Seth, Philip Stone, and Ke Huy Quan star in supporting roles. In
          the film, after arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by desperate
          villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee
          cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice
          in honor of the goddess Kali. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was
          released on May 23, 1984, to financial success but initial reviews were
          mixed, criticizing its darker elements, strong violence and gore, as well
          as Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott. However, critical opinion has
          improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination.
